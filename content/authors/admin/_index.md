      I arrived at the creation of the infrastructure team, when the company realized that it needed to have a dedicated team to manage the infrastructure. We are now a team of 3 people, and we are responsible for the entire infrastructure of Shine.
      My missions can be slight changes (like adding a optional feature to an existing resource), big projects (like implementing a complete hosting solution on top of GCP with Terraform), or to prepare the future by creating tailored Terraform modules for the developers.
      We rely heavily on tools like Terraform, GCP, ElasticSeach, Grafana.

      My responsibilities cover:
      - Managing Shine's entire infrastructure in GCP, including containers (serverless), instances (MIG), queues, databases, and load-balancers.
      - Transitioning infrastructure management from nothing to Terraform, by providing several repositories in a self-service mode and with helpful and tailored modules.
      - Automating processes via GitHub Actions.
      - Setting up monitoring with Grafana (in Terraform): managing logs, metrics, and dashboards.

Hi, I‚Äôm Jonathan, a 39-year-old from Lille, France, who enjoys spending time with software as if it's Lego bricks at Shine.

I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, having worked with and maintained a variety of infrastructures and services over the years. My career has revolved around the web, giving me a strong background in managing high-traffic websites and HTTP. I‚Äôm all about the KISS philosophy and standardization, applying these principles in my daily work. Also, big fan of UNIX here.

I'm not fixated on bleeding-edge technology; I prefer infrastructures that ensure everyone's peace of mind, including mine. Still, I'm always keen to learn and welcome new tools that can make my infrastructures even more dependable.

Feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre looking for a remote worker.
